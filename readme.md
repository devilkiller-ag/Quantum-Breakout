# Quantum Breakout
Quantum Version of Classic Breakout Game

Inspired by QPong

I am happy to announce The Quantum Breakout Game which I built as a part of Team Abraxas for showcasing at Fest Nimbus, the annual technical fest of the National Institute of Technology Hamirpur. This is a quantum version of the Classic Breakout Game by Atari, Inc built using Pygame and Qiskit. In the Classic Breakout Game, the player has to knock down as many bricks as possible by using a single ball and the paddle below to hit the ball against the bricks and eliminate them. In this quantum version of the game, players have to control the paddle by constructing three qubits circuit such that the probability of the paddle being above the state vector where the ball is about to come is maximum. 

I have built this game to help school students and college freshmen to understand the basic concept of quantum computing: Qubit manipulation by Quantum Gates. I will shortly publish a detailed description and How to Play Guide for this game here. 

This game is highly inspired by the QPong game developed by Junye Huang. I am thankful to him and Qiskit for releasing a basic tutorial of building QPong in a youtube series: 12 Days of Qiskit (https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOFEBzvs-VvodTkP_rfrs3RWdeWE9aNRD) without which it would have been hard for me to develop this game.
